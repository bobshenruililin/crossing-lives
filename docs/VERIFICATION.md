# Verification record

## Known-green baseline, 6 October 2026

Commit `c29034126c39a4971eb0eaf62bcf729954840f8c` passed the full private GitHub Actions workflow:
- TypeScript, 28 domain tests and production build/export
- All 13 browser cases, first attempt
- Real Chromium/Chrome rendering at 360px, 390px and 1440px
- Complete original story/planner/choice/reload/reset loop, constraints, group costs, FX, return route, allocation keyboard interaction, source navigation
- Keyboard dialog behavior, reduced motion, media failure, blocked/corrupt storage and restored defaults
- Axe checks for the main views
- The portable HTML opened from file with network offline and completed a choice

[Exact passing run](https://github.com/bobshenruililin/crossing-lives/actions/runs/37475455524)

Actual screenshots were independently reviewed. That review led to a mobile two-row header, an intentionally composed invitation strip, readable supporting text, a compact live two-city comparison, clear per-person/deadline labels and a common absolute timeline scale. Passing tests alone did not establish those visual improvements.

## Playable-evening pass, work in progress

The current source adds a six-beat fictional evening, Jun, two matched night scenes, meaningful meal/walk commitments, one disclosed delay, checkpoint rewind, a preserved alternate and explicit familiarity without city defaults.

Current local verification: TypeScript, production build and 74 unit tests pass (37 domain, 20 persistence, 17 story). A dedicated expanded browser suite is being prepared for both city endings, night/portrait decoding, replay, late return, eligibility, keyboard and offline execution. These additions are **not covered by the baseline browser clearance** until the exact new commit passes.

Original images, new portrait alpha and night-scene geometry were individually inspected. Those asset checks do not replace rendered application review.

## Browser infrastructure and export history

The cloud workspace blocks local Chromium process sockets. Its browser tool also disallows local file URLs. No workaround or weakening of local security was used.

Private GitHub CI initially failed before page load because downloaded Chromium headless-shell lacked a usable sandbox on Ubuntu 24.04. A documented, supported stable Chrome channel on the same hosted image solved this with `chromiumSandbox:true`; AppArmor/sysctl/security settings stayed unchanged. See [the diagnosis and sources](CI_BROWSER.md).

The first real run exposed an invalid portable export: string replacement interpreted literal dollar sequences inside the bundled React source. Callback replacement, exact embedded-source comparison and syntax validation fixed it. Subsequent offline browser execution verified the exported file, rather than relying only on static parsing.

Repository visibility remains private. No public deployment or hosting configuration is included.
